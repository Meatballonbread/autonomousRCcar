An attempt to make my remote-controlled car drive autonomously using 3 GoPros, a Rasperry Pi, an Arduino and mediocre programming skills us ing a neuro network and openCV. The image is to be evaluated live and integrated directly into the driving behavior of the car. Test videos are from YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00fkIDtgzUY
